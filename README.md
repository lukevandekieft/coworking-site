# _Coworking Site Pitch_

#### _A start to finish site development for a theoretical coworking client, September 21 2018_

#### By _**Luke Vandekieft**_

## Description

_This project is an exercise in developing a website based on a theoretical client request. The full-cycle workflow will go as follows:_
* _Identify target users & their stories_
* _Research design ideas & layouts based on the target users and client requests_
* _Hand-draw pages to decide on page layouts_
* _Turn drawn layouts into a hi-fi site mockup_
* _Turn said mockup into a functioning prototype_
* _Create webpage that accurately reflects the prototype_

_By engaging in this exercise I hope to practice & demonstrate my ability to fulfill a client request in a professional & efficient manner. If you have any suggestions or comments I would love to hear! Feel free to contact me at vandekie@gmail.com._


## Target Users

_Our client's business is a new, luxurious-yet-open coworking space with an open feel and various amenities. Based on this information I've created user personas for some target users:_

  * _Use appealing images/design/etc. that feel accessible._

## User Stories

* _As a prospective customer, I want the site to clearly show what the business space looks like._
* _As a prospective customer, I want to know about amenities, pricing, and other reasons to join._
* _As a customer, I want an up-to-date list of amenities such as activity schedules, coffee flavors, and so forth._
* _As a customer, I want an easy way to contact staff._
* _As a manager, I want an easy way to update information on the site._
* _As an owner, I want the website aesthetic to accurately reflect my company's branding._

## Design Decisions
_The client's design requests can be summarized as:_
* _Minimum 4 pages: homepage, contact, membership detail, and detailed amenities page._
* _Luxurious, cool aesthetic that still feels 100% accessible._
* _Funky, fun, & local feel that separates them from competitors._
* _Open design that doesn't pigeonhole us with tech workers._
* _Incorporate physical space in online design: space is bright, open, pastel-colored, and modern-feeling. Plants and light woods are abundant and a recurring heart/love theme is used subtlely._

_Based on these I've decided to go with a modern, image-heavy site that uses pop/pastel colors in a tasteful manner._

_Upscale restaurants & housing sites tend to be very image-heavy as this is what ultimately sells the product. They tend to have minimalist menus at the top that keep the site functional without detracting from the overall feel. Examples include the Aman hotel site, Tusk restaurant, and The Honours restaurant (sans excessive animations)._

_I decided to go with a pastel, modern, and vaguely retro feel for the design as this felt both appropriate for the business and distinctive. The client's competitors take a minimalist design approach but a colorful look is more unique and welcoming. This classy pastel color scheme is something I've seen work successfully in Mackinac Island's Grand Hotel (not the website!), Portland's Tusk restaurant, and various makeup ad campaigns. In particular I found Portland's Tusk website to be inspiring as it looks very fun & inviting while still conveying the image of luxury - it's simply luxury that isn't exclusive. The art style will be distinctly NOT techy and convey a funkier Portland flavor that makes it appeal to Portlanders of all sorts._

_This design should meet prospective customer needs by presenting instant visual appeal while still providing useful information. The menu will be clear & navigable enough that the visuals won't be too distracting for returning users & admins simply trying to get the site work. The majority of our prospective users will be tech-savvy enough to understand basic web navigation as most contractors/freelancers/remote workers/creatives looking for a shared urban space will already use the internet for some part of business._
