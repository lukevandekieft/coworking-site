# _Coworking Site Pitch_

#### _A start to finish site development for a theoretical coworking client, September 14 2018_

#### By _**Luke Vandekieft**_

## Description

_This project is an exercise in developing a website based on a theoretical client request.  The full-cycle workflow will go as follows:_
* _Identify target users & their stories_
* _Research design ideas & layouts based on the target users and client requests_
* _Hand-draw pages to decide on page layouts_
* _Turn drawn layouts into a hi-fi site mockup_
* _Turn said mockup into a functioning prototype_
* _Create webpage that accurately reflects the prototype_

_By engaging in this exercise I hope to practice & demonstrate my ability to fulfill a client request in a professional & efficient manner. If you have any suggestions or comments I would love to hear! Feel free to contact me at vandekie@gmail.com._
